# Version 1 – Architecture Design (2-Tier)

## Goal

Establish DevOps foundations using a minimal but realistic 2-tier system.

## Architecture

- Backend API (Flask)
- Database (PostgreSQL)

No frontend is included in Version 1 to keep focus on infrastructure, CI/CD, and deployment.

## DevOps Focus

- Environment-driven configuration
- Container-first mindset
- CI before CD
- Cloud deployment using EC2

## Why 2-Tier?

- Reduces complexity
- Enables focus on DevOps fundamentals
- Mirrors many internal enterprise services
