# DevOps Evolution Project 🚀

This repository documents a hands-on DevOps learning journey where a simple application is continuously evolved into a production-grade system.

## Goals

- Learn DevOps the **right way**
- Understand system evolution (v1 → v2 → v3)
- Practice real Git, CI/CD, Docker, and AWS workflows

## Project Philosophy

- DevOps-first, application-second
- One repository, multiple versions
- Every change is documented and versioned

## Versions

- v1.0 – 2-tier application (Flask + DB)
- v2.0 – 3-tier architecture
- v3.0+ – Production-grade DevOps

> This repo is a living system, not a one-time demo.
